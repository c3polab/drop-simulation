# drop-simulation
A simulation to predict the optimal tendon stiffnesses and lever lengths for energy recovery in a 3-DOF leg.

To run the simulation, open the file world.wbt in webots and press the run simulation button in webots.

The Robot.wbo file is the leg physical model. It contains all the information about the structure, mass, and physics of the leg. 

The optimization.py file is the optimization code.
